## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### **Role-Based Logic:**
```typescript
// Different content based on user role
{userRole === UserRole.TEAM_MEMBER ? 'My Tasks' : 'All Tasks'}

// Role-specific quick actions
const getQuickActions = (role: UserRole) => {
  // Base actions for all + role-specific additions
}
```

### **Real-Time Data Processing:**
```typescript
// Comprehensive metrics calculation
const taskStats = {
  total: allTasks.length,
  completed: allTasks.filter(t => t.status === 'DONE').length,
  userTotal: userTasks.length,
  userCompleted: userTasks.filter(t => t.status === 'DONE').length,
  // ... more metrics
}
```

### **Professional Modal System:**
```typescript
// Reusable modal component with proper validation
<QuickActionModal isOpen={isModalOpen} onClose={closeModal}>
  {/* Form content with validation */}
</QuickActionModal>
```
