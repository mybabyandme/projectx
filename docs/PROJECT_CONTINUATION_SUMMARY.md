## 🎯 **CONTINUATION STRATEGY**

### **Immediate Development Path** (Next 1-2 weeks)

#### **1. Dashboard Implementation** 
```typescript
// Priority 1: Create dashboard overview
Files to create:
- src/app/[orgSlug]/page.tsx (update existing empty page)
- src/components/dashboard/dashboard-overview.tsx

- src/app/api/organizations/[orgSlug]/dashboard/route.ts

Features to implement:
- Project overview cards with progress indicators
- Recent task activity feed
- Team productivity metrics summary
- Quick action buttons (Create Project, Add Task)
- Role-based dashboard content
```

#### **2. Project Management CRUD**
```typescript
// Priority 2: Complete project management
Files to create:
- src/app/[orgSlug]/projects/new/page.tsx
- src/app/[orgSlug]/projects/[projectId]/page.tsx
- src/components/projects/project-form.tsx
- src/components/projects/project-detail-view.tsx
- src/app/api/organizations/[orgSlug]/projects/route.ts

Features to implement:
- Project creation with methodology selection
- Project detail view with task breakdown
- Project editing and status management
- Team assignment per project
```

#### **3. Calendar Integration**
```typescript
// Priority 3: Visual project management
Files to create:
- src/app/[orgSlug]/calendar/page.tsx
- src/components/calendar/project-calendar.tsx
- src/components/calendar/calendar-event.tsx

Features to implement:
- Full calendar view with project timelines
- Task due dates and milestone display
- Drag-and-drop date updates
```

### **Established Patterns to Follow**

#### **Component Creation Pattern**
```typescript
// Follow this pattern for new components:
1. Create page component in app/[orgSlug]/[feature]/page.tsx
2. Create view component in components/[feature]/[feature]-view.tsx
3. Use ResultsList for data display when appropriate
4. Implement mobile-first responsive design
5. Add proper error handling and loading states
6. Use established authentication patterns
```

#### **API Development Pattern**
```typescript
// Follow this pattern for new API routes:
1. Validate session with auth()
2. Check organization membership
3. Validate user permissions for operation
4. Use Zod schemas for input validation
5. Return consistent response format
6. Handle errors with proper HTTP status codes
```

## 🔄 **ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS FOR CONTINUATION**

### **Proven Patterns to Continue**
1. **Multi-tenant data access**: Always scope queries by organizationId
2. **Role-based permissions**: Check user role before rendering components/actions
3. **Mobile-first design**: Use responsive utility classes throughout
4. **Component composition**: Leverage ResultsList for consistent data display
5. **Error boundaries**: Implement comprehensive null safety checks

### **Component Library Standards**
- **Forms**: Use react-hook-form with Zod validation
- **Data Display**: Use ResultsList component for consistency
- **Navigation**: Follow established breadcrumb and layout patterns
- **Modals**: Use Radix UI components with proper accessibility
- **Charts**: Use Recharts library for data visualization

### **Database Patterns**
- **Queries**: Always include organization filtering
- **Relations**: Use Prisma include for nested data
- **Validation**: Server-side validation with Zod schemas
- **Migrations**: Use Prisma migrate for schema changes

## 🚨 **CRITICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR NEW DEVELOPER**

### **Security Requirements**
- **Never bypass role checking**: Always validate user permissions
- **Organization scoping**: All queries must filter by organizationId
- **Input validation**: Use Zod schemas for all form inputs
- **Authentication**: Verify session on all protected routes

### **Performance Guidelines**
- **Database optimization**: Use selective field loading with Prisma
- **Component optimization**: Implement proper React.memo where needed
- **Bundle optimization**: Use dynamic imports for heavy components
- **Mobile performance**: Test on actual mobile devices

### **Code Quality Standards**
- **TypeScript strict mode**: Maintain type safety throughout
- **Error handling**: Always implement try-catch for API calls
- **Loading states**: Provide visual feedback for all async operations
- **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG guidelines for new components
